## Code Generation & Testing
* **Keep README.md and txtar tests up to date:** When adding new features, ensure that the `README.md` documentation and `txtar` tests (in `templates/testdata`) are updated to reflect the changes. This helps maintain a comprehensive regression suite and up-to-date documentation.
