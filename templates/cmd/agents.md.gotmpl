# Go Subcommand Information

Go Subcommand (`gosubc`) generates subcommand code for command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Go from source code comments.

## Key Features

- **Convention over Configuration:** Define your CLI structure with simple, intuitive code comments.
- **Zero Dependencies:** The generated code is self-contained and doesn't require any external libraries.
- **Automatic Code Generation:** `gosubc` parses your Go files and generates a complete, ready-to-use CLI.

## How it works

1.  **Define Your Commands**: Create a Go file and define a function that will serve as your command. Add a comment above the function in the format `// FunctionName is a subcommand 'root-command sub-command...'`.
2.  **Generate**: Run `gosubc generate` (or via `go generate`).
3.  **Result**: `gosubc` creates a `cmd/<app-name>` directory containing the generated CLI code.

## Comment Syntax

- `// FuncName is a subcommand 'root-cmd parent child'` defines the command.
- `Flags:` block defines flags.
  - `name: --flag -f (default: val) Description`
- `@N` maps positional arguments.
- `...` maps variadic arguments.

## Important Note

Do not edit files in this directory directly if you can avoid it. They are overwritten on every generation. Modify the source code comments instead.
